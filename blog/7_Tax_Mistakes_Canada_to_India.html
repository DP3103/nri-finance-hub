      <h1>7 Tax Mistakes When Moving from Canada to India (And How to Avoid Them)</h1>
      <p>
        Moving from Canada to India involves complex tax implications that can cost you thousands if handled incorrectly. Here are the seven critical tax mistakes NRIs make during this transition—and proven strategies to avoid them.
      </p>
      <ol>
        <li>
          <strong>Not Understanding Tax Residency Status</strong><br>
          Many assume they automatically become non-resident for Canadian tax purposes upon leaving. However, Canada uses multiple tests including residential ties, days of presence, and intent. Failing to properly establish non-residency can result in continued Canadian tax obligations on worldwide income. Consult a tax professional and formally establish your departure date with CRA.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Ignoring the Departure Tax on Deemed Dispositions</strong><br>
          Canada imposes departure tax on certain assets when you cease to be a resident, treating them as if sold at fair market value. This applies to stocks, mutual funds, and other investments. The tax can be substantial and unexpected. Plan ahead by either paying the tax, posting security, or transferring eligible assets to a spouse who remains in Canada.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Mishandling RRSP and RRIF Withdrawals</strong><br>
          Withdrawing from RRSPs/RRIFs as a non-resident triggers 25% withholding tax (or lower treaty rate of 15% with India). Many make large withdrawals without considering the tax impact. Instead, consider keeping funds in the plan, making smaller periodic withdrawals, or converting RRSP to RRIF for lower minimums if over 65.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Failing to Report Foreign Assets in India</strong><br>
          Indian residents must report foreign assets and income, including Canadian bank accounts, investments, and property. The Foreign Assets (FA) schedule and Black Money Act have strict compliance requirements with heavy penalties for non-disclosure. Maintain detailed records and file appropriate schedules with your Indian tax return.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Double Taxation on Investment Income</strong><br>
          Without proper planning, investment income from Canadian sources can be taxed in both countries. The Canada-India tax treaty provides relief, but you must actively claim foreign tax credits. Keep records of Canadian taxes paid and claim appropriate credits on your Indian return to avoid double taxation.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Incorrect Handling of Principal Residence Exemption</strong><br>
          Selling your Canadian home before departure may qualify for principal residence exemption, but timing matters. If you become non-resident first, different rules apply. Consider whether to sell before departure, maintain residency status, or plan for non-resident property tax implications.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Not Planning for Future Canadian Income</strong><br>
          Many overlook ongoing Canadian income like rental properties, pensions, or investment returns. As a non-resident, you'll face withholding taxes and may need to file Canadian returns. Plan for these obligations and consider structures to minimize tax impact while maintaining compliance in both countries.
        </li>
      </ol>
      <h2>Final Thoughts</h2>
      <p>
        The Canada-to-India tax transition requires careful planning and professional guidance. Start planning at least a year before your move, understand both countries' requirements, and maintain detailed records. The cost of professional tax advice is minimal compared to the penalties and double taxation you could face from mistakes.
