            <h1>7 Big Tax Mistakes to Avoid When Moving from Canada to India</h1>
            <p>Moving from Canada to India involves complex tax implications that can cost you thousands if handled incorrectly. Here are the seven critical tax mistakes NRIs make during this transition—and proven strategies to avoid them.</p>
            
            <ol>
                <li>
                    <strong>Not Understanding Tax Residency Status</strong>
                    <p>Many assume they automatically become non-resident for Canadian tax purposes upon leaving. However, Canada uses multiple tests including residential ties, days of presence, and intent. Failing to properly establish non-residency can result in continued Canadian tax obligations on worldwide income.</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Consult a tax professional before departure</li>
                        <li>Formally establish your departure date with CRA</li>
                        <li>Document your intent to permanently leave Canada</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                
                <li>
                    <strong>Ignoring the Departure Tax on Deemed Dispositions</strong>
                    <p>Canada imposes departure tax on certain assets when you cease to be a resident, treating them as if sold at fair market value. This applies to stocks, mutual funds, and other investments. The tax can be substantial and unexpected.</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Plan ahead by either paying the tax or posting security</li>
                        <li>Consider transferring eligible assets to a spouse who remains in Canada</li>
                        <li>Get professional valuation for significant holdings</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                
                <li>
                    <strong>Mishandling RRSP and RRIF Withdrawals</strong>
                    <p>Withdrawing from RRSPs/RRIFs as a non-resident triggers 25% withholding tax (or lower treaty rate of 15% with India). Many make large withdrawals without considering the tax impact.</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Consider keeping funds in the plan for tax deferral</li>
                        <li>Make smaller periodic withdrawals to manage tax burden</li>
                        <li>Convert RRSP to RRIF for lower minimums if over 65</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                
                <li>
                    <strong>Failing to Report Foreign Assets in India</strong>
                    <p>Indian residents must report foreign assets and income, including Canadian bank accounts, investments, and property. The Foreign Assets (FA) schedule and Black Money Act have strict compliance requirements with heavy penalties for non-disclosure.</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Maintain detailed records of all foreign assets</li>
                        <li>File appropriate schedules with your Indian tax return</li>
                        <li>Understand the reporting thresholds and requirements</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                
                <li>
                    <strong>Double Taxation on Investment Income</strong>
                    <p>Without proper planning, investment income from Canadian sources can be taxed in both countries. The Canada-India tax treaty provides relief, but you must actively claim foreign tax credits.</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Keep records of Canadian taxes paid</li>
                        <li>Claim appropriate foreign tax credits on your Indian return</li>
                        <li>Understand treaty provisions for different types of income</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                
                <li>
                    <strong>Incorrect Handling of Principal Residence Exemption</strong>
                    <p>Selling your Canadian home before departure may qualify for principal residence exemption, but timing matters. If you become non-resident first, different rules apply.</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Consider whether to sell before or after departure</li>
                        <li>Understand the impact on residency status</li>
                        <li>Plan for non-resident property tax implications if keeping the home</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                
                <li>
                    <strong>Not Planning for Future Canadian Income</strong>
                    <p>Many overlook ongoing Canadian income like rental properties, pensions, or investment returns. As a non-resident, you'll face withholding taxes and may need to file Canadian returns.</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Plan for ongoing tax obligations in Canada</li>
                        <li>Consider structures to minimize tax impact</li>
                        <li>Maintain compliance in both countries</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
            </ol>
            
            <h2>Bonus: Smart Exit Timing</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>Plan your departure for early in the tax year to minimize dual residency period</li>
                <li>Consider timing major transactions (like property sales) around your departure date</li>
                <li>Coordinate with Indian arrival timing to optimize tax residency status in both countries</li>
            </ul>
            
            <h2>Summary</h2>
            <p>The Canada-to-India tax transition requires careful planning and professional guidance. Start planning at least a year before your move, understand both countries' requirements, and maintain detailed records. The cost of professional tax advice is minimal compared to the penalties and double taxation you could face from mistakes. Remember, proper planning can save you thousands in taxes and compliance costs while ensuring you meet all legal requirements in both jurisdictions.</p>
