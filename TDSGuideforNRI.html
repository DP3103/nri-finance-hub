    <h1>Understanding TDS for NRIs: 2025 Guide</h1>
    <p>Tax Deducted at Source (TDS) is an area of great confusion for many Non-Resident Indians (NRIs). If you’re wondering if TDS applies to you, which incomes are subject to TDS, or what the current rates are, read on for a clear, actionable summary.</p>
    
    <h2>What is TDS and When Is It Due?</h2>
    <p>TDS is a form of tax that is deducted before income is paid out to you. For example, banks deduct TDS from the interest you earn before depositing the remaining amount in your account.</p>
    <div class="highlight">
      TDS is typically due when you receive:
      <ul>
        <li>Interest income</li>
        <li>Dividends</li>
        <li>Rental income</li>
        <li>Capital gains from shares, mutual funds, real estate, or other assets</li>
      </ul>
    </div>
    
    <h2>Can NRIs Reclaim TDS?</h2>
    <p>Yes! If you have paid more TDS than required, you can file an income tax return to reclaim the excess amount. It’s important to ensure correct deductions to avoid unnecessary penalties.</p>
    <div class="note">
      What happens if TDS isn’t deducted? Authorities may impose penalties, so make sure your income is evaluated correctly under the law to avoid issues.
    </div>
    
    <h2>TDS Applicability for NRIs</h2>
    <p>TDS applies to most kinds of income sourced in India, such as:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Interest from bank deposits and bonds</li>
      <li>Stock dividends</li>
      <li>Capital gains (short-term and long-term) from mutual funds, shares, and property sales</li>
    </ul>
    <div class="note">
      However, interest earned on NRE fixed deposits and FCNR deposits is typically exempt.
    </div>
    
    <h2>Updated TDS Rates for 2025</h2>
    <p>A recent update has changed the TDS rate on property sales (long-term gains, held for over 24 months) from <strong>20%</strong> to <strong>12.5%</strong>. Be aware that some professionals may not be up-to-date and could reference the old rate.</p>

    <h2>Surcharge and Cess on TDS</h2>
    <p>These TDS rates are subject to:</p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Surcharge:</strong> 10% if income exceeds ₹50 Lakhs, increasing at higher thresholds
        <ul>
          <li>₹50 Lakhs–1 Crore: 10%</li>
          <li>₹1–2 Crore: 15%</li>
          <li>₹2–5 Crore: 25%</li>
          <li>Above ₹5 Crore: 37%</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li><strong>Cess:</strong> 4% on the total tax plus surcharge</li>
    </ul>
    
    <h2>How Can You Lower Your TDS?</h2>
    <p>If the standard rates seem high, you may apply for a lower deduction certificate (Form 13) under Section 197. This allows you to request a reduction or exemption based on your actual tax liability.</p>
    
    <h2>Importance of the TDS Certificate</h2>
    <p>A TDS certificate is crucial for three main reasons:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Proof of tax payment: Confirms taxes have been paid to authorities.</li>
      <li>Claiming refunds: Required when requesting a refund for excess TDS.</li>
      <li>Income tax filing: Serves as proof when filing Indian tax returns.</li>
      <li>Double taxation: Useful for claiming relief under double tax treaties (DTAA).</li>
    </ul>
    
    <h2>Takeaways and Next Steps</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Double-check the latest TDS rates (property sales now at 12.5%).</li>
      <li>Use official documentation or table summaries for clarity.</li>
      <li>Apply for a lower deduction certificate if eligible.</li>
      <li>Always collect and safeguard your TDS certificates for compliance, refunds, and filing needs.</li>
    </ul>
